# This file is used by Cloudflare Pages Functions
# Place it in the root directory for Cloudflare Pages to recognize server functions

# Cloudflare Pages automatically serves functions from the /functions directory
# Our server code is in /server, so we need to configure the build output

# The build process creates dist/index.js which is the compiled server code
# Cloudflare Pages will use this for handling API requests
